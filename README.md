pycircstat
==========


From the director of "CircStat: A Matlab toolbox for circular statistics" and the director of "Natter: A Python Natural Image Toolbox" comes now a new toolbox:

**PyCircStat: circular statistics with Python**

Starring: descriptive and inferential statistics

Note: The toolbox is currently in  development. Many functions are working, but many are yet to come. We encourage you to start using the toolbox and provide feedback on bugs, features you would like and so on.

Until there is a dedicated article describing the toolbox, please credit this web page. 

Team: Philipp Berens, Fabian Sinz, Tom Wallis, Matthias KÃ¼mmerer and Matthias Bethge

You can also install it via
