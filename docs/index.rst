Welcome to PyCircStat's documentation!
======================================

All functions take arguments in radians (expect for ang2rad).
For a detailed description of arguments and outputs consult the help text of the respective functions.

The implementation follows in most cases 'Biostatistical Analysis' and all referenced equations and tables
are taken from this book, if not otherwise noted. In some cases, the other books were preferred for implementation
was more straightforward for solutions presented there.

If you have suggestions, bugs or feature requests or want to contribute code, please email us.
